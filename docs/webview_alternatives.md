# Webview Options for Windows 7 Compatibility

## Overview

This document outlines webview options that maintain compatibility with Windows 7, focusing on alternatives to modern WinRT-based webview implementations, including older versions of the webview library if available.

## Webview Library (Older Versions)

Unfortunately, the main webview library (https://github.com/webview/webview) does not have older versions that support Windows 7 out of the box. The library has been designed with modern Windows versions in mind, utilizing WinRT components which are not available on Windows 7.

However, there are forks and alternatives that aim to provide similar functionality for older Windows versions:

### 1. Webview2 (Microsoft Edge WebView2)

While not a direct replacement for the webview library, WebView2 offers similar functionality and has versions that support Windows 7.

- **Minimum Supported Version for Windows 7**: WebView2 SDK 1.0.622.22
- **Download**: [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- **Documentation**: [WebView2 Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- **GitHub**: [WebView2Samples](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/WebView2Samples)

#### Key Features:
- Modern web capabilities based on Chromium
- Supports Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, and Windows 10
- Regular updates and security patches

#### Example Usage:
```cpp
#include <webview2.h>

HRESULT hr = CreateCoreWebView2Environment(
    nullptr, nullptr, nullptr,
    Callback<ICoreWebView2CreateCoreWebView2EnvironmentCompletedHandler>(
        [](HRESULT result, ICoreWebView2Environment* env) -> HRESULT {
            // Create WebView2 here
            return S_OK;
        }).Get());
```

## Conclusion

While the original webview library doesn't have older versions supporting Windows 7, alternatives like WebView2 provide similar functionality with Windows 7 support. The choice between these options depends on factors such as required web features, performance needs, and integration complexity. WebView2 offers a good balance of modern features and Windows 7 compatibility, with the backing of Microsoft for updates and support.
